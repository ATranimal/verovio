LibMEI
------

The code for the attribute classes of Verovio are generated from the MEI schema using a modified version of LibMEI available [here](https://github.com/rism-ch/libmei). The code generated is included in the Verovio repository in ./libmei and the LibMEI repository does not need to be cloned for building Verovio.

The  attribute classes generated from the MEI schema provide all the members for the model in MVC design of Verovio. They are implemented via multiple inheritance in element classes. The element classes corresponding to the MEI elements are not generated by LibMEI but are implemented explicitly in Verovio. They all inherit from the `vrv::Object` class or from a `vrv::Object` child class.

For example, the MEI &lt;note&gt; is implemented as a `vrv::Note` class that inherit from `vrv::Object` through `vrv::LayerElement`. In addition to this, it also interits from `vrv::DurationInterface` and `vrv::PitchInterface` that regroup common functionnalities for durational and pitched MEI elements respectively.

```
class Note: public LayerElement, public DurationInterface, public PitchInterface,
  public AttColoration,
  public AttNoteLogMensural,
  public AttStemmed,
  public AttTiepresent
```
