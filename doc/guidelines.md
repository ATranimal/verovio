LibMEI
------

The code for the attribute classes of Verovio are generated from the MEI schema using a modified version of LibMEI available [here](https://github.com/rism-ch/libmei). The code generated is included in the Verovio repository in ./libmei and the LibMEI repository does not need to be cloned for building Verovio.

The classes generated from the MEI schema provide all the members for the model in MVC design of Verovio. They are used via multiple inheritance.
