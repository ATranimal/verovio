Verovio is designed as a fast, portable and lightweight tool usable as a one-step conversion tool. It is written in pure standard C++ with no dependencies on third-party frameworks and libraries. This ensures maximum portability of the codebase. Verovio implements its own rendering engine, which can render SVG with all the musical symbols embedded in it and without dependency on external fonts. Since the rendering engine is defined as an abstract class, it is possible easily to implement a rendering output different from SVG if needed (e.g., PDF, or HTML Canvas).
